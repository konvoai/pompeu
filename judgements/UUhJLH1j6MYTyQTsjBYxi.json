  "quality": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is efficient and focused. The buyer asks a clear question about physical store locations, and the store provides a comprehensive, well-structured answer with all relevant details (addresses, hours, additional services). The store also asks appropriate follow-up questions to continue helping the customer. There's no redundancy or circular discussion. The exchange is direct and useful, though it would be even better if the customer's needs were fully resolved.",
    "score": 0.88
  },
  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "The information provided by the store appears factually consistent (addresses, hours, locations). However, the store is providing information about locations in Colorado and Utah (US states), which seems unusual for a conversation conducted entirely in Catalan. This raises questions about whether this is accurate for the context, though we cannot definitively say it's incorrect without more information. The response is relevant and directly addresses the buyer's question about physical store locations.",
    "score": 0.85
  },
  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "Both parties communicate in proper Catalan throughout the conversation. The buyer's message is well-written with correct grammar and spelling. The store's response is also in excellent Catalan with proper use of accents (ubicacions, física, assessorament, etc.), appropriate punctuation, and clear structure. No Spanish or English intrusions are present. The language is natural and professional.",

  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is incomplete. The buyer asked about physical store locations and the store provided detailed information about 5 locations with addresses and opening hours. However, the buyer hasn't confirmed if this information was helpful, hasn't indicated which store they'll visit, and hasn't gotten answers about which specific products they wanted to see. The conversation ended with the store asking follow-up questions that remain unanswered.",
