Sí, fem enviaments a adrecis als Estats Units, incloent-hi la que has indicat: 2847 Canyon Boulevard, Boulder, CO 80302. Aquesta és precisament l'adreça de la nostra botiga insígnia a Boulder, així que si prefereixes recollir la comanda directament allà, també oferim l'opció de compra en línia amb recollida a la botiga el mateix dia (si està disponible). L'enviament és gratuït per a comandes superiors a 75 dòlars.\n\nSi em dones més detalls sobre els productes que t'interessen (com ara tendes, motxilles o equipament d'escalada), et puc ajudar a triar o confirmar disponibilitat. Què et sembla? 😊"

  "quality": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is efficient and focused. The buyer asks a single clear question about shipping to a specific address, and the store provides a comprehensive, direct answer that not only confirms the shipping but also offers additional helpful information about the store location, free shipping threshold, and pickup options. The store also proactively asks about product interests to continue helping. This is a well-structured exchange with no unnecessary back-and-forth.",
    "score": 0.92
  },
  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "All information provided appears accurate and relevant. The store confirms shipping to the US address, mentions it's their flagship store location, offers pickup options, and provides accurate information about free shipping over $75. There are no apparent inaccuracies or irrelevant personal commentary. Everything stays on topic and directly addresses the customer's shipping inquiry.",
    "score": 0.95
  },
  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is conducted entirely in proper Catalan with excellent grammar and spelling throughout. Both parties use correct Catalan syntax, proper accents (adreça, què, dòlars, tendes, motxilles), and appropriate formality. The use of 'adrecis' (plural form) and all other Catalan expressions are correct. No Spanish, English, or other language interference is present (aside from proper nouns like 'Boulder' and 'CO' which are unavoidable). Minor points: 'insígnia' could be debated but is acceptable in Catalan context. Overall, this is high-quality Catalan.",

  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The customer's question about shipping to the specific address was fully answered. The store confirmed that they do ship to that location and provided additional relevant information. However, the conversation is still ongoing as the store is asking about product interests to continue helping. The initial query was resolved, but there's no explicit customer confirmation of satisfaction and the transaction isn't complete yet. The issue appears resolved but lacks final confirmation.",
