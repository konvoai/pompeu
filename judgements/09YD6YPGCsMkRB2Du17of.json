La nostra política de devolucions a Mountain Peak permet retornar articles fins a **60 dies després de la compra**, així que amb només 13 dies estàs perfectament dins del termini! 😊\n\nPer poder processar la devolució, necessitaràs:\n- El **tiquet de compra** original\n- Que el producte estigui **sense usar** i amb les **etiquetes originals**\n\nSi el producte ja ha estat utilitzat, també el podem acceptar però només si és **defectuós** i dins dels primers 14 dies (que també és el teu cas).\n\nPer fer la devolució, pots:\n1. Portar l'article a qualsevol de les nostres botigues\n2. O si el vas comprar online, pots iniciar el procés de devolució a través del nostre lloc web\n\nQuin producte vols retornar? Hi ha algun problema amb ell o simplement has canviat d'opinió? Així et puc ajudar millor! 🏔️"

  "quality": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is efficient and well-structured. The store representative provides a comprehensive, clear response that directly addresses the customer's question about returning a product purchased 13 days ago. The response includes all relevant information (60-day return policy, requirements, options for return) in a single message without unnecessary back-and-forth. The agent also proactively asks follow-up questions to better assist the customer. However, the conversation is incomplete as the customer hasn't responded yet, so we can't assess if there was any redundancy or if the issue was fully resolved.",

  },
  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "The information provided appears accurate and relevant. The store representative clearly states the return policy (60 days), explains the requirements (original receipt, unused with tags, or defective within 14 days if used), and provides two options for processing the return (in-store or online). All information is directly relevant to the customer's inquiry about returning a product. There are no incorrect facts or irrelevant personal remarks. The response is professional and on-topic throughout.",
    "score": 0.95
  },
  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is conducted entirely in proper Catalan with excellent grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Both parties use correct Catalan throughout. The store representative uses natural, fluent Catalan with proper vocabulary ('devolució', 'tiquet de compra', 'etiquetes originals', 'defectuós'). There are no Spanish, English, or other language intrusions. The syntax is correct, and the use of formatting (bold text, emojis) enhances readability without compromising linguistic quality. Minor consideration: emojis are neutral elements that don't affect language quality.",

  },
  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The customer's initial question about whether it's possible to return a product purchased 13 days ago has been answered affirmatively by the store representative. However, the conversation is incomplete because the customer hasn't confirmed satisfaction, provided details about the product they want to return, or indicated their next steps. The store representative has asked follow-up questions that remain unanswered. The issue appears to be on track for resolution, but it's not yet complete as the conversation has just begun and the actual return process hasn't been initiated.",
