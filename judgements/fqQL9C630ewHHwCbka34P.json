    "reasoning": "Since there is no actual content in the conversation - only an empty message - there is no information to evaluate for accuracy or relevance. No claims were made, no information was provided, and therefore nothing can be assessed for correctness.",

    "reasoning": "There is no text content to evaluate for grammar, spelling, or language usage. The single message from the buyer is empty, containing no words in Catalan or any other language. Without any linguistic content, this scores the minimum.",
