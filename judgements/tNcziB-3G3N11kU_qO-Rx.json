  "quality": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is efficient and focused. The customer asks for the store address, receives a comprehensive list of all locations, then clarifies they want the main store address specifically. The store responds appropriately with the exact information requested. While there's a slight redundancy (the main store address was already in the first response), the exchange is productive and resolves the need in just 4 messages total. The store provides clear, well-organized information both times.",

  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "All information provided appears accurate and relevant. The store gives specific addresses with street numbers, cities, and zip codes. The responses directly address the customer's questions. There is no off-topic content or personal commentary. The store correctly identifies the flagship/main store location in Boulder when asked for clarification. All information is factually consistent across both responses.",

  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is conducted in Catalan with generally good quality. However, there are several errors: 1) The buyer says 'quin és l'adreça' which should be 'quina és l'adreça' (adreça is feminine). 2) The buyer says 'quin és l'adreça exacta' with the same gender agreement error. 3) 'direcció' (Spanish) is used in the table header instead of 'adreça' (Catalan). Otherwise, vocabulary, syntax, and punctuation are appropriate. The errors are noticeable but don't significantly impede understanding.",

  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The customer's issue is completely resolved. They asked for the store address, received comprehensive information including all locations, then clarified they wanted the main store specifically, and received the exact address of the flagship store. The customer's need for the main store address has been fully satisfied. While there's no explicit confirmation of satisfaction from the customer, the store provided all requested information clearly and the conversation reached a natural conclusion with the answer provided.",
