The gear needs to be in its original condition with all the tags attached.\n\nIf you happen to have used the gear and find it to be defective, you can return it within 14 days of purchase.\n\nDo you have any other questions about our return policy?"

    "reasoning": "The conversation is efficient and direct. The customer asks a clear question about the return policy, and the store provides a comprehensive answer that covers the standard return window (60 days), conditions for returns (original condition, tags, receipt), and even includes additional information about defective items (14 days). The response fully addresses the customer's question in a single exchange with no unnecessary back-and-forth. The store also offers to answer additional questions, which is good customer service. This is an ideal, focused exchange.",

  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "The information provided appears to be accurate and relevant to the customer's inquiry about return policy. The store gives specific details about timeframes, conditions, and special cases (defective items). All information is directly related to the return policy question asked. However, this conversation is NOT in Catalan - it appears to be in English, which is a significant issue for correctness in the context of the required language.",

  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "This conversation is entirely in English, not Catalan as required. The instructions explicitly state that the conversation must be in Catalan and that heavy penalties should be applied for use of Spanish, English, or other languages. Both the buyer and store are using English throughout the entire conversation. Despite the English being grammatically correct, this completely fails the requirement for Catalan language usage.",

  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The customer's question about the return policy timeframe was fully answered with comprehensive details. The store provided the 60-day return window, conditions for returns, and information about defective items. The store also asked if there were any other questions, giving the customer an opportunity to seek clarification. While the customer didn't explicitly confirm satisfaction, the question was thoroughly addressed and the conversation appears complete. The customer's need was met.",
