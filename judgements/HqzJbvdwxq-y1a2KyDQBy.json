Com que només han passat 13 dies, no hi haurà cap problema. Només assegura't que el producte estigui sense ús i amb les seves etiquetes originals.\n\nSi el producte té algun defecte, també pots retornar-lo dins dels 14 dies posteriors a la compra.\n\nGràcies per preguntar!"

  "quality": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is highly efficient and effective. The customer asks a straightforward question about return eligibility for a product purchased 13 days ago. The store representative provides a comprehensive, direct answer that fully addresses the question in a single response. The answer includes: confirmation that returns are possible, the full policy (60 days), specific conditions (product in good condition with receipt), additional helpful information about product state requirements (unused with original tags), and even mentions the defect policy. No unnecessary back-and-forth occurred, and the issue was resolved in just two messages.",

  "correctness": {
    "reasoning": "All information provided appears accurate and relevant. The store representative correctly states the return policy (60 days from purchase date), properly addresses the customer's specific situation (13 days is well within the limit), and provides accurate conditions for returns (good condition, receipt, unused, with original tags). The additional information about defective products (14 days) is also relevant and helpful. There are no inaccuracies, no personal commentary, and all content is directly related to the customer's inquiry.",

  "grammar": {
    "reasoning": "The conversation is written in proper Catalan throughout. Both parties use correct spelling, punctuation, and syntax. The customer's message is clear and well-formed. The store representative's response demonstrates excellent Catalan with proper vocabulary ('atorga', 'rebut', 'etiquetes originals', 'posteriors'), correct verb conjugations, and appropriate formal tone. There are no Spanish, English, or other language interferences. The text flows naturally with proper sentence structure and punctuation. No significant errors detected.",

  "completeness": {
    "reasoning": "The customer's question was completely answered. They wanted to know if they could return a product purchased 13 days ago, and the store representative provided a definitive 'yes' with comprehensive details about the return policy, conditions, and even additional relevant information. While the customer didn't explicitly confirm satisfaction (e.g., 'thank you, that helps'), the store's response was so thorough and direct that it leaves no unanswered questions. The issue appears fully resolved, though there's no explicit customer confirmation.",
